# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Change usages of `Collections.unmodifiableList(...)` so that they are compiled out in
  production mode.

* Investigate other tools and see if they offer any ideas:
